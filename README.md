# Bike Rental System in Python

When you start the program, you will see 6 options:

1. Display available bikes
2. Request a bike on an hourly basis - 3 euro
3. Request a bike on a daily basis - 20 euros
4. Request a bike on a weekly basis - 60 euros
5. Return a bike
6. Exit

Any option can be chosen an unlimited number of times until the user chooses to exit.

Since classes are used various customers and bike rental shops can be instantiated as needed.

For the sake of simplicity, we'll suppose that each customer only asks for one form of rental—hourly, monthly, or weekly—but is free to select the number of bikes they need. The number of desired bikes should be less than the supply on hand.
